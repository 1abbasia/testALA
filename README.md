# Book Bunch

## What is Book Bunch?

Contrary to popular belief, Millennials read more than older generations doâ€”and more than the last generation did at the same age! An [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/millennials-are-out-reading-older-generations/379934/) about the 2014 Pew Research Center report said that "Deeper connections with [books] are also often associated with key life moments such as having a child, seeking a job, being a student, and going through a situation in which research and data can help inform a decision." Soooo...basically all all of your 20's. Everything on the internet is interconnected. What better place to have a list of the books you've found on forbes, ESPN, instagram, in a youtube video, amazon etc. than Book Bunch.

- View books on a user profile archived in the database
- Add books to the (by searching the google books api)

- And delete books from the database
